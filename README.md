# VSGraph ‚Äî Interactive Dashboard for German Intelligence Reports

**VSGraph** is a data-driven dashboard built with **Next.js, Liftkit, and Tremor** to analyze Germany‚Äôs annual domestic intelligence reports (Verfassungsschutzberichte, since 2000).  
It focuses on long-term trends in extremist crime (e.g., left- vs. right-wing motivated crimes) and aims for clarity, transparency, and reproducibility.

> Design philosophy: modern, accessible, **glassmorphism-inspired** UI (soft blur, subtle borders, gentle shadows) without heavy ‚Äúmaterial‚Äù vibes.
